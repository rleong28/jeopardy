Jeopardy ISP Limitations

- I used getChar() for the mainMenu() and levelSelection()
methods, so you only need to type in the character that 
represents your choice to indicate your choice. If you press 
the enter key afterwards, it'll give you an error message when
you are brought to the next screen. So, you don't have to 
press enter to indicate your choice.

- The meximum possible length for your answer or wager is 44
characters and the program will not accept any characters that
are typed once you are past that limit except for the 
backspace and enter keys. So, depending on which combination
of characters you type, your answer will stop at different
points of the textbox. This is not an error. I made it 44
characters because that is the maximum number of w's you can 
fit in the textbox, and w's are the fattest character.
